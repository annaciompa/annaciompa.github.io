        How did I get here? When did my love for coffee begin? 
        I actually remember the times when I considered the taste of coffee to be awful. 
        Then I added a lot of sugar and milk to my coffee at some point... aaand it tasted better.
        It was a long time ago so I cannot recall the details but I think 
        it was only after I have tasted specialty coffee when realized that I do no need sugar in it.
        I am still working on being able to resist having milk in my cup. 
        My love for coffee has been growing gradually for the past few year and now I am kind of coffee addict.
        I don't need my coffee every day. But I need good quality coffee in my life!
        I am in France now and I do not have any coffee equipment here with me so the only option is to visit cafés. And that's an activity that really makes me smile :) 
            It actualy is one my favorite activities. 
            This is a list of my favorite activities now:
                <ol><li>hiking or walking in the nature (parcs, forests)</li>
                <li>walking around historical cities</li>
                <li>visiting cafés</li>
                <li>experimenting with vegan ingredients - cooking for my husband </li>
                <li>jogging maybe?</li>
                </ol>
